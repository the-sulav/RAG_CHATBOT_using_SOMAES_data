what is SOMAES HUB:SOMAES Hub is a project that is initiated for providing reading resources to Mechanical Engineering students . Since the students are unknown about the resources they can get in internet and it’s a tedious job to do so, we have made it easier for you by creating a SOMAES hub which consist of all the requirement from 1st semester to 8th semester.
Here are  list of books and other materials arranged in order of semesters. Also, those who have extra resources that may be helpful to your friends or juniors apart from these can contact SOMAES Committee Members to supply those resources.
